        <h2>How sponsorship outreach actually works</h2>
        <ol className="campaign-steps">
          <li>
            <strong>Build your warm list (15 min).</strong> List 5 local businesses your family
            already has a real relationship with: dentist, mechanic, restaurant, parent&apos;s
            employer, neighbor with a small business. Skip big-box stores and strangers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Visit in person if you can.</strong> Lead with the relationship (&quot;I&apos;ve been
            coming here for 8 years&quot;), make the ask, hand them the leave-behind 1-pager, set a
            follow-up week, thank them. 90 seconds, not a sales pitch.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Follow up.</strong> Most yeses come on the second contact. Don&apos;t take a no
            personally — it&apos;s usually a budget cycle, not a rejection.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Share the giving link.</strong> The sponsor can give without signing in.
            Confirmed gifts appear in your sponsorship total. Staff reviews public recognition;
            the booster team reconciles check payments.

        <h2>Online tracker</h2>
        <p>
          Add businesses your family knows and mark each business after you make contact.
          If you request a band introduction, staff reviews the request before sending.
          Check its status in the tracker before you visit. Warmed leads appear when businesses
          have expressed interest and are available to claim.

            An online gift is confirmed after payment completes. A check gift stays pending until
            staff verifies receipt. Confirmed gifts receive an automatic receipt; public sponsor
            recognition follows staff review. Student attribution recognizes participation in
            program support and does not create a personal spending balance.
